* Dubbing (=tlon-dub.el=)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-dub
:END:

This module provides functionality to interact with the ElevenLabs Dubbing API, allowing users to dub audio or video files into different languages.

** Dependencies
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-dub-dependencies
:END:

+ =tlon-core=
+ =tlon-tts= (for API key retrieval and language selection)
+ =tlon-ai= (for AI model interaction and common AI utilities)
+ =json= (for parsing API responses)
+ =threads= (for the =cond->= macro)
+ =transient= (for the menu system)
+ =gptel=, =gptel-core= (for AI model selection infrastructure)
+ External tools: =curl= (for API requests), =whisperx= (for local transcription).

** Standard Workflow
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-dub-workflow
:END:

This workflow presupposes that we already have (1) the original audio and video files, (2) a human-edited transcript and (3) a translation into the target language made from that transcript.

1. Generate a JSON transcript with timestamps from the original audio file using ~tlon-dub-transcribe-with-whisperx~ (Audio -> JSON).
2. Create an English SRT file by combining the timestamps from the WhisperX JSON output with your human-edited English transcript (plain text/Markdown) using ~tlon-dub-propagate-machine-timestamps~ (JSON + en.txt -> en.srt).
3. Create a translated SRT file by combining the timestamps from the English SRT file with your translated transcript (plain text/Markdown) using ~tlon-dub-propagate-english-timestamps~ (en.srt + lang.txt -> lang.srt).
4. Create a CSV file from the English SRT and the translated SRT using ~tlon-dub-convert-srt-to-csv~ (en.srt + lang.srt -> .csv). This CSV will be in the format required by ElevenLabs (speaker, start_time, end_time, transcription, translation).
5. Go to [[https://elevenlabs.io/app/dubbing]] and create a new manual dubbing project, uploading the original audio/video files and the CSV file created in the previous step.

** User Options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-dub-options
:END:

#+vindex: tlon-dub-propagation-model
+ ~tlon-dub-propagation-model~ :: Specifies the AI model to use for the ~tlon-dub-propagate-timestamps~ command. The value is a cons cell where the =car= is the backend name (e.g., "ChatGPT", "Gemini") and the =cdr= is the model symbol (e.g., =gpt-4.5-preview=, =gemini-2.0-flash-exp=). If =nil=, the default =gptel-model= is used. This can be set via the ~tlon-dub-menu~.

** Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-dub-commands
:END:

#+findex: tlon-dub-start-project
+ ~tlon-dub-start-project~ :: (Autoloaded) Initiates a new dubbing project with ElevenLabs. Prompts for the source *audio/video file*, source language (ISO code), target language (ISO code), a name for the project, and optionally: a specific ElevenLabs voice ID, whether to create in *Dubbing Studio mode* (allows adjustments via the web UI), and the expected *number of speakers*. The function checks if the source file has a supported audio/video extension (e.g., mp3, wav, mp4, webm) before proceeding. It sends the request to the ElevenLabs API and displays the response, which typically includes the =dubbing_id=. *After successful creation, it automatically attempts to share the project with the user associated with the current API key (using the top-level =user_email= field and =tlon-email-shared=) with 'editor' permissions to enable further API interactions.* Signals an error if the file type is not supported or if project creation fails. Logs a warning if sharing fails.

#+findex: tlon-dub-get-project-metadata
+ ~tlon-dub-get-project-metadata~ :: (Autoloaded) Retrieves metadata for an existing ElevenLabs dubbing project. Prompts for the =dubbing_id= of the project. It sends a GET request to the API and displays the JSON response containing project details like status, languages, etc.

#+findex: tlon-dub-get-dubbing
+ ~tlon-dub-get-dubbing~ :: (Autoloaded) Retrieves and parses the dubbing (expected VTT format) for a specific language within an ElevenLabs dubbing project. Prompts for the =dubbing_id= and the desired =language_code= (e.g., "en", "es"). It attempts to parse the VTT file into a list of segments (plists with =:start=, =:end=, =:text=). Displays the parsed segments (pretty-printed) in a new buffer or the raw transcript if parsing fails. Returns the list of segments or the raw transcript string.

#+findex: tlon-dub-get-resource-data
+ ~tlon-dub-get-resource-data~ :: (Autoloaded) Retrieves the detailed resource structure for an ElevenLabs dubbing project. Prompts for the =dubbing_id=. This endpoint is expected to return JSON containing resource, speaker, and segment IDs needed for modification. Displays the parsed JSON response (pretty-printed) in a new buffer or the raw response if parsing fails.

#+findex: tlon-dub-add-speaker-segment
+ ~tlon-dub-add-speaker-segment~ :: (Autoloaded) Adds a new segment for a specific speaker within an ElevenLabs dubbing project. Prompts for the =dubbing_id=, =speaker_id=, segment =start_time= (float, seconds), =end_time= (float, seconds), and the segment =text=. Sends a POST request to the API and displays the response.
#+findex: tlon-dub-transcribe-with-whisperx
+ ~tlon-dub-transcribe-with-whisperx~ :: (Autoloaded) Generates a JSON transcript for a given audio or video file *asynchronously* using the `whisperx` command-line tool. Prompts the user to select an =audio-file=. The command then runs `whisperx` with `--compute_type float32`, `--output_format json`, and specifies the output directory (`--output_dir`) to be the same as the input file's directory. The output `.json` file is created by `whisperx` in that directory. A message is displayed in the echo area upon completion, and an output buffer (e.g., `*whisperx-filename.mp4-output*`) is created to show `whisperx`'s stdout/stderr.
#+findex: tlon-dub-propagate-machine-timestamps
+ ~tlon-dub-propagate-machine-timestamps~ :: (Autoloaded) Propagates timestamps from a =whisperx=-generated JSON transcript to a human-edited plain text/Markdown transcript using an AI model. Prompts for the =machine-transcript= (JSON) and the =human-transcript= (text/Markdown). The AI attempts to align timestamps from the JSON file with the human-edited text. The resulting timestamped transcript is saved as a new SRT file (e.g., =human-transcript-timestamped.srt=). The AI model used can be configured via ~tlon-dub-propagation-model~.
#+findex: tlon-dub-propagate-english-timestamps
+ ~tlon-dub-propagate-english-timestamps~ :: (Autoloaded) Propagates timestamps from a timestamped English SRT file to a translated plain text/Markdown file (which lacks timestamps) using an AI model. Prompts for the =english-timestamped-file= (SRT, typically the output of ~tlon-dub-propagate-machine-timestamps~) and the =translated-file= (text/Markdown). The AI attempts to align the timestamps from the English SRT file with the translated text. The resulting timestamped translated transcript is saved as a new SRT file (e.g., =translated-file-timestamped.srt=). The AI model used can be configured via ~tlon-dub-propagation-model~.
#+findex: tlon-dub-convert-srt-to-csv
+ ~tlon-dub-convert-srt-to-csv~ :: (Autoloaded) Converts a pair of timestamped English and translated SRT files into a CSV file formatted for ElevenLabs. Prompts for the =english-srt-file=, the =translated-srt-file=, and an =output-csv-file= path. The output CSV has columns: =speaker,start_time,end_time,transcription,translation=. The function validates that both SRT files have the same number of segments and that corresponding segments share identical start and end timestamps; it raises an error if these conditions are not met.

#+findex: tlon-dub-align-punctuation
+ ~tlon-dub-align-punctuation~ :: (Autoloaded) Aligns punctuation between a text file and a Markdown file using AI. Both files contain transcripts of the same audio, but may differ in their punctuation. The AI will revise the Markdown file so that its sentence boundaries match those in the text file. Prompts for the =text-file= and the =markdown-file=. The resulting aligned Markdown file is saved with a "-aligned" suffix. The AI model used can be configured via ~tlon-dub-propagation-model~.

** Menu
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-dub-menu
:END:

#+findex: tlon-dub-menu
+ ~tlon-dub-menu~ :: (Autoloaded) Displays a transient menu for Tlön Dubbing functionalities. It provides access to commands for interacting with the ElevenLabs API, using =whisperx= for transcription, converting VTT files, and propagating timestamps. It also allows configuration of the AI model used for timestamp propagation.
