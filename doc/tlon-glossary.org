* Glossary Management (=tlon-glossary.el=)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-glossary
:END:

This module provides functions for managing a multilingual glossary stored in a JSON file. It allows users to edit entries, add translations, and extract the glossary in different formats for various recipients (humans, DeepL editor, DeepL API).

** Configuration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-glossary-config
:END:

*** Glossary Source File
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-file-glossary-source
:END:
#+vindex: tlon-file-glossary-source
The constant ~tlon-file-glossary-source~ defines the path to the JSON file containing the master glossary data. By default, it points to =glossary.json= within the =babel-core= repository.

*** Glossary Recipients
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-glossary-recipients
:END:
#+vindex: tlon-glossary-recipients
The constant ~tlon-glossary-recipients~ is an alist defining the email addresses associated with specific target languages for sharing human-readable glossaries. Each entry is a plist with =:language= (language code string) and =:email= (email address string).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defconst tlon-glossary-recipients
  '((:language "fr" :email "tlon-french@googlegroups.com")
    (:language "it" :email "tlon-italian@googlegroups.com")))
#+end_src

** User Options
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-glossary-options
:END:

This section describes the user-configurable options available in =tlon-glossary.el=.

*** Custom Models
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-glossary-custom-models
:END:

~tlon~ allows specifying different AI models for specific tasks, overriding the default =gptel= model configuration. This enables using models optimized for particular capabilities.

Each option takes a cons cell =(BACKEND . MODEL)=, where =BACKEND= is a string (e.g., ="ChatGPT"=, ="Gemini"=) and =MODEL= is a symbol representing the specific model (e.g., =gpt-4.5-preview=, =gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21=). Refer to ~gptel-extras-ai-models~ for available options. If an option is nil, the default =gptel= model is used for that task.

#+vindex: tlon-ai-glossary-model
+ ~tlon-ai-glossary-model~ :: Model used by ~tlon-ai-create-glossary-language~ for generating translations for missing glossary terms.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq tlon-ai-glossary-model '("Gemini" . gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21))
  #+end_src

#+vindex: tlon-ai-glossary-verify-model
+ ~tlon-ai-glossary-verify-model~ :: Model used by the second step of ~tlon-ai-create-glossary-language~ for verifying and cleaning the translations generated by the first AI.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq tlon-ai-glossary-verify-model '("Gemini" . gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21))
  #+end_src

** Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-glossary-commands
:END:

This section details the interactive commands provided by =tlon-glossary.el=.

*** Edit Glossary Entry
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-edit-glossary
:END:
#+findex: tlon-edit-glossary
The command ~tlon-edit-glossary~ provides an interactive way to create or update entries in the glossary file (~tlon-file-glossary-source~).

1. It parses the existing glossary using ~tlon-parse-glossary~.
2. It prompts the user to select a source language and then choose an existing term in that language (using completion) or add a new one.
3. If the term is new:
   - It prompts the user to select the term type (=variable= or =invariant=) using ~tlon-select-term-type~.
   - It creates a new entry structure using ~tlon-create-entry~. For invariant terms, it automatically adds entries for all target languages, using the source term as the initial translation.
4. If the term exists or is newly created and is not of type =invariant=:
   - It calls ~tlon-edit-translation-in-entry~ to prompt the user for a target language and the corresponding translation for the selected source term. It updates the entry with the new or modified translation.
5. It updates the main glossary data structure with the modified or new entry using ~tlon-update-glossary~.
6. It writes the updated glossary back to the JSON file using ~tlon-write-data~.

*** Extract Glossary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-extract-glossary
:END:
#+findex: tlon-extract-glossary
The command ~tlon-extract-glossary~ extracts a glossary for an arbitrary language pair from the main JSON file and saves it in a format suitable for a specified recipient.

1. It prompts the user to select the source and target =LANGUAGE= codes using ~tlon-select-language~.
2. It prompts the user to select the =RECIPIENT= type (=human=, =deepl-editor=, =deepl-api=, or =sieve=) using completion.
3. It determines the target file path and extension based on the languages and recipient using ~tlon-glossary-target-path~.
4. It reads the source glossary JSON file.
5. It creates or opens the target file and inserts the formatted glossary content using ~tlon-insert-formatted-glossary~, filtering and formatting entries based on the recipient:
   - =human=: Includes only "variable" type entries, formatted as CSV (="Source","Target"=).
   - =deepl-editor=: Includes all entries, formatted as CSV (="Source","Target","SRC","TGT"=) using the selected language codes.
   - =deepl-api=: Includes all entries, formatted as TSV (=Source\tTarget=).
   - =sieve=: Includes all entries that have a translation, formatted as a JSON object (={"Source": "Target", ...}=). Standard apostrophes (') in both source terms (keys) and target terms (values) are replaced with typographic apostrophes (â€™).
6. It saves the target file.
7. If the recipient is =human=, it asks the user if they want to share the extracted glossary via email using ~tlon-share-glossary~.
8. For other recipients (=deepl-editor=, =deepl-api=, =sieve=), it messages the path to the extracted file.

*** Extract Multilingual Glossary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-extract-multilingual-glossary
:END:
#+findex: tlon-extract-multilingual-glossary
The command ~tlon-extract-multilingual-glossary~ writes a CSV file containing
all existing translations for every term in the master glossary. It is useful
for translators onboarding a new target language.

- It detects all language keys present across entries (including any source language).
- It writes a header row with the language codes.
- Each subsequent row contains the translation for that term in each language
  (empty if missing).
- The file is saved to your downloads directory as =ALL.csv=.

*** Share Glossary
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-share-glossary
:END:
#+findex: tlon-share-glossary
The command ~tlon-share-glossary~ sends an extracted glossary file as an email attachment to the designated translators for a specific language.

1. It prompts the user to select the glossary =ATTACHMENT= file (defaulting to the downloads directory).
2. It prompts the user to select the =LANGUAGE= of the glossary (unless provided as an argument).
3. It looks up the recipient email address for the language in ~tlon-glossary-recipients~ using ~tlon-lookup~.
4. It looks up the full language name (e.g., "French") using ~tlon-lookup~ on ~tlon-languages-properties~ and sets the ~tlon-email-language~ variable.
5. It calls ~tlon-email-send~ with the ="share-glossary.org"= template, the recipient email, and the attachment path.

*** Glossary Menu
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-glossary-menu
:END:
#+findex: tlon-glossary-menu
The command ~tlon-glossary-menu~ activates a =transient= menu interface providing quick access to the main glossary functions:
+ =e= :: Edit glossary entry (~tlon-edit-glossary~)
+ =x= :: Extract glossary (~tlon-extract-glossary~)
+ =s= :: Share glossary (~tlon-share-glossary~)
+ =a= :: AI Create Language (~tlon-ai-create-glossary-language~)
+ =m -g= :: Select model for glossary generation (~tlon-ai-infix-select-glossary-model~)
+ =m -v= :: Select model for glossary verification (~tlon-ai-infix-select-glossary-verify-model~)

*** AI Glossary Generation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:tlon-ai-create-glossary-language
:END:
#+findex: tlon-ai-create-glossary-language
The command ~tlon-ai-create-glossary-language~ uses an AI model to generate translations for missing terms from a chosen source language into a chosen target language. This command can be run iteratively to gradually complete a language's glossary.

1. It prompts the user to select the source and target language codes using ~tlon-select-language~.
2. It reads the current glossary data from ~tlon-file-glossary-source~.
3. It filters the glossary to find entries that have a term in the selected source language but lack a translation for the selected target language.
4. It extracts the source-language terms from these missing entries.
5. If no terms are missing for the chosen language pair, it informs the user and exits.
6. It formats a prompt (~tlon-ai-create-glossary-language-prompt~) instructing the first AI (model defined by ~tlon-ai-glossary-model~) to generate translations for the provided list of source-language terms into the target language. The prompt asks the AI to return only the plain text translations, one per line.
7. It sends the request (containing the missing source terms as a newline-separated plain text list) to the first AI using ~tlon-make-gptel-request~.
8. The first callback function (~tlon-ai-create-glossary-language-callback~) receives the raw response from the first AI.
9. It saves this raw response to a temporary file in the downloads directory (e.g., =ai-glossary-ES-IT-raw-temp.txt=).
10. This callback then formats a second prompt (~tlon-ai-verify-glossary-translations-prompt~) instructing a second AI (model defined by ~tlon-ai-glossary-verify-model~) to clean and verify the raw response. This prompt asks the AI to ensure the output is a plain text list with exactly the expected number of lines, removing any extraneous text or formatting and using placeholders if necessary.
11. It sends the verification request to the second AI.
12. The second callback function (~tlon-ai-process-verified-translations-callback~) handles the response from the verification AI:
    - It cleans the verified response (removes potential markdown fences).
    - It splits the cleaned response string into a list of translation strings using newlines as delimiters (=received-translations=).
    - It checks if the number of translation lines received matches the number of source terms originally sent (=source-terms=). If not, it issues a warning message but continues processing.
    - It reconstructs the list of pairs by combining the original =source-terms= list with the verified =received-translations=, processing only up to the minimum of the number expected and the number received. It skips any translation that is exactly the string =\"[TRANSLATION_UNAVAILABLE]\"=.
    - It iterates through the reconstructed (and filtered) =[\"source_term\", \"translation\"]= pairs:
      - It finds the corresponding entry in the full glossary data where the source-language term matches =source_term=.
      - If found, it adds the new target language key-value pair (e.g., =(\"it\" . \"traduzione\")=) to that entry (or updates it if it already existed).
    - It writes the entire updated glossary data structure back to ~tlon-file-glossary-source~ using ~tlon-write-data~.
    - It reports the number of non-placeholder translations successfully merged.
    - On success, it deletes the temporary raw response file saved earlier.
    - If any step fails (AI error in either step, invalid format in verified response), it reports an error, logs the relevant AI response, and leaves the temporary raw response file in the downloads directory for inspection.
