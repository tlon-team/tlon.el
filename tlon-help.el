;;; Commentary:

;; Provides functions to get help using AI, potentially leveraging documentation
;; from multiple repositories.

;;; Code:

(require 'tlon-core)
(require 'tlon-ai) ; For tlon-ai-callback-fail, tlon-ai-insert-in-buffer-and-switch-to-it
(require 'subr-x)  ; For string-join

;;;; Configuration

;; Define your repositories and their paths
;; Use an alist: (("repo-id" . "/path/to/repo/root") ...)
;; TODO: User should customize these paths
(defvar tlon-help-doc-repos
  '(("tlon.el" . "~/git/tlon/tlon.el") ; Example path
    ("extras" . "~/git/dotfiles/emacs/extras")) ; Example path
  "Alist mapping repository identifiers to their root paths for documentation lookup.")

;; Define the extensions for documentation files
(defvar tlon-help-doc-extensions '("org") ; Changed default to just org based on previous function
  "List of file extensions considered as documentation.")

(defvar elpaca-repos-directory) ; Define if not already globally available

;;;; Helper Functions (Moved and Renamed)
